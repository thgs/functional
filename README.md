## functional

This is a very experimental repository where I try to see how some functional
concepts can be expressed and constructed in PHP.

I tried initially to express some concepts as good as I could understand them
and very quickly realised that a very very similar approach was used in
[marcosh/lamphpda](https://github.com/marcosh/lamphpda). That is a more complete
library.
